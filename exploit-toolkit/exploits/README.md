# Exploit Collection

This exploit collection comprises scripts, snippets and tools that can be used to attack the *Unguard* demo application
and showcase common vulnerabilities of all sorts.

## Command Injection

[Execute arbitrary shell commands](./cmd-injection/README.md) with one of the following:

* [In Java](./cmd-injection/CMDI-IMAGE-POSTING.md), in the image posting feature of the `proxy-service`
* [In Java](./cmd-injection/CMDI-MARKDOWN-CONVERSION.md), in the markdown conversion in the  `profile-service`
* [In Lua](./cmd-injection/CMDI-LUA.md), through a Lua filter in the `envoy-proxy`

All three services do not properly validate user input.

## CRLF Injection

Inject custom queries to a Redis instance via [header injection](./crlf-injection/README.md).

## JWT Forgery

Authenticate as another user via a [forged JSON web token](./jwt-forgery/README.md).

## Log4Shell

Achieve RCE by abusing the [Log4Shell vulnerability](./log4shell/README.md) that allows JNDI injection.

## SSRF

Access and exploit internal services through [Server Side Request Forgery](./ssrf/README.md).

## Zip Slip

Write arbitrary files [with specially crafted archives holding directory traversal filenames.](./zip-slip/README.md).

## SQL Injection

[Run SQL commands](./sql-injection/README.md) by sending unchecked payloads.

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[Inject arbitrary HTML](./xss/README.md) into your profile page.
