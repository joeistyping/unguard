# Command injection

Unguard has three command injection vulnerabilities:

* Two of them in Java
    * [The first Java CMD injection](CMDI-IMAGE-POSTING.md) that is exploited through the image posting feature of
      the `proxy-service`
    * [A second Java CMD injection](CMDI-MARKDOWN-CONVERSION.md) that is exploited through the markdown conversion that
      happens when setting a bio string with markdown enabled on the `profile-service`
* [In Lua](CMDI-LUA.md), through a Lua filter in the `envoy-proxy`
